Whatever you have done
And whatever you may do
Love has made you what you are
And it's love I feel for you

No matter where you go
I will always come to you
I'll be your friend
Right to the end
In the shadow of the night

Baby find a star and any star
Will lead you back to me
Love makes you
What you are
You're everything to me

People wish for many things
Things they'll never be
But I won't wish for anything
as long as you stay by me

Love makes you
