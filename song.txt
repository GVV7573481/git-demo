Love Makes You

What you are inside you
Carry with you always
And everything you do
Is reflection of you
No matter where you are
No matter what you do
I will be there to show you
I care in the shadow of the night

Only love makes you
What you are
And what you are
Is everything to me
Baby find a star and any star
Will lead you back to me

Love makes you
What you are
You're everything to me
Whatever you have done
And whatever you may do
Love has made you what you are
And it's love I feel for you

No matter where you go
I will always come to you
I'll be your friend
Right to the end
In the shadow of the night

Baby find a star and any star
Will lead you back to me
Love makes you
What you are
You're everything to me

People wish for many things
Things they'll never be
But I won't wish for anything
as long as you stay by me

Love makes you
