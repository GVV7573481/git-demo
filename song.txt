Love Makes You

What you are inside you
Carry with you always
And everything you do
Is reflection of you
No matter where you are
No matter what you do
I will be there to show you
I care in the shadow of the night

Only love makes you
What you are
And what you are
Is everything to me
Baby find a star and any star
Will lead you back to me
Love makes you
What you are
You're everything to me
